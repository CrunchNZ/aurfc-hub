## Project Basics
- Goal: Build AURFC Hub, a responsive web app for Auckland University Rugby Football Club to centralize communication, team management, scheduling, and a Junior Portal for 300+ juniors, supporting 700 total members and resolving scattered info pain points.
- Tools to Use: React.js for frontend, Firebase for backend (Firestore DB, Authentication, Cloud Functions, Storage, Hosting), npm for dependencies. Keep it basic: No advanced libs yetâ€”add Firebase ML Kit later for AI innovations.
- Important Rules: Make everything mobile-responsive, secure (e.g., role-based access), and scalable to 1000 users. Focus on MVP functionality without pre-filled content. Use real-time features for chats/calendars.
- AI Helper Instructions: Always check this file first before making code. Prioritize rapid MVP coding today.
