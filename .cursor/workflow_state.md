## Current State
Phase: MVP Start (focus on auth, dashboards, and core features today).

## Plan
1. Set up Firebase configuration in src/firebase.js using the project's Firebase credentials.
2. Implement authentication service in src/services/auth.js with sign-up, login, and role-based access.
3. Create Login component in src/components/Login.js integrated with auth service.
4. Set up basic routing and main App.js structure.
5. Add tests for auth functions in tests/.
6. Test locally with Firebase emulators.

## Rules
1. Read all files before doing anything.
2. Make a plan first, then code.
3. Test everything to make sure it works (use Firebase emulators for local testing).
