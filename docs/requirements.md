- Users (admins, coaches, players, parents) can sign up, log in, and update profiles with role-based access (e.g., juniors require parental consent).
- Centralized communication: In-app chat, notifications, and news feed to replace WhatsApp/emails/websites.
- Team management: Coaches build rosters, track performance/injuries, create drills/playbooks.
- Scheduling: Shared calendar for events/trainings with RSVPs and attendance.
- Junior Portal: Dedicated section for notes, content uploads (skills/drills/videos), basic gamification (badges), and parent dashboard.
- Handle errors, like offline access via PWA and no internet for Firebase syncs.
- Innovations (post-MVP): AI coaching (video analysis), wearable integration, hall of fame section for pro players, sponsorship displays.

## Additional MVP Requirements (Enhancements for Robustness)

### Authentication Enhancements
- Forgot Password/Reset Functionality: Allow users to recover accounts via email-based password reset.
- Email Verification on Sign-Up: Require email confirmation to validate accounts and reduce spam.

### Security and Compliance
- Explicit Data Privacy and Consent Handling: Include GDPR/child data protection compliance, with UI prompts for parental consent during junior sign-up.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Details: Enforce roles via Firebase Security Rules for data access (e.g., coaches can edit rosters, players view only).

### Usability and Accessibility
- Mobile Responsiveness and PWA Polish: Ensure full responsiveness on mobile devices and enhance PWA for offline use.
- Onboarding Tutorial: Provide a simple welcome flow or tooltips to guide new users through key features.

### Monitoring and Feedback
- Basic Analytics and Error Reporting: Integrate Firebase Analytics for usage tracking and Crashlytics for error monitoring.
- User Feedback Mechanism: Add an in-app form for users to report issues or suggestions.

### Testing and Deployment
- Environment-Specific Requirements: Set up dev/test/prod environments with appropriate logging and testing configurations.
- Integration Testing for Key Flows: Conduct end-to-end tests for critical user paths (e.g., sign-up to event RSVP).
