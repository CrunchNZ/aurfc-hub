# AURFC App Build Task List

This file tracks the build progress based on requirements.md and user rules. Tasks are completed sequentially, with all sub-tasks tested and marked before moving on.

## Self-Rules for Task Completion
- Follow user rules: Environment segregation, TDD (tests for every new code, remove one-off tests), modularity (<300 lines/file, split if needed), automated docs/logging.
- Step-by-Step: Break tasks into sub-tasks; complete/test one at a time.
- Testing: Test each sub-task (unit/integration/manual) before marking complete; fix issues (up to 3 attempts) or ask user.
- Marking: Mark sub-task as [Complete] after testing; main task as [Complete] when all sub-tasks done.
- Feedback: Ask user only if necessary (e.g., clarifications); otherwise, proceed.
- Progress: Update this file as we go; commit changes per rules.
